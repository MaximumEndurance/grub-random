## Provide for randomly changing wallpapers in the grub background.

The crazy aim is to generate a Linux implementation of changing log-in backgrounds in Windows.

### Installation

**Note** : An active internet connection is required to download background images.

1. Download the file install-grub-random
2. Then in a terminal enter :

    ```
    chmod 777 install-grub-random
    sudo ./install-grub-random 
    ```
    


Tip: You can change the images to be shown during boot by adding/removing images in the ~/grubSplashImages directory.

Godspeed.
