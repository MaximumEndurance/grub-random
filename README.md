## This script provides for randomly changing wallpapers in the grub background.

The aim is to generate a Linux implementation of changing log-in backgrounds in Windows.

###Installation

Note that an active internet connection is required to download images

Download the file install-grub-random
and then in a terminal enter :

chmod 777 install-grub-random
sudo ./install-grub-random 


Note: You can change the images to be shown during boot by adding/removing images in the ~/grubSplashImages directory.

Godspeed.
